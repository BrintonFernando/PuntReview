        <Paragraph>
          Hi- weâ€™ve never cruised before but frequent the casinos. Just got an
          offer for free carnival cruise, free drinks in the casino, and casino
          cash. Anyone ever take them up on this offer? <br /> <br />I think
          about $500 is what I do. What happens is I spend an amount on the
          slots and win some back and play on that. Usually, if I play for a
          couple of hours on that, I can get offers. One of my first cruises, I
          won a few hundred and played on that the whole cruise, and it looked
          like I spent a TON, but I only spent a couple hundred.
